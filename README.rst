nozama-cloudsearch
==================

A light weight implementation of Amazon's CloudSearch service for local testing
purposes.

The running REST service hosts its own docs generated from sphinx. I've also
upload to readthedocs.org here:

* https://nozama-cloudsearch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

This documents the API I've implemented so far.
